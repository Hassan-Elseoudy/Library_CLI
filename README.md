# Library_CLI

1. ```git clone https://github.com/Hassan-Elseoudy/Library_CL ```
2. Run it using your java compiler or your preferred IDE!

#### Note: If I had all the time In the life, I'd added
1. Using Commander design patter, encapsulatin each command with each validation.
2. Handle more validation cases, The project based on an INTELLIGENT user, but it shouldn't be the case.
3. Dockerizing the application, so you don't depend on the OS.
4. Adding MySQL connection, but yet, I'm not pretty sure about the tester environment.
5. Adding tests, full documentation, but :))
